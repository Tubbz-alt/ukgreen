Heads up on the plan project


It is clear that capitalist civilisation, which has rested since the
19th century on the use of fossil fuel energy to replace human muscle
power, is leading to a huge climate change.

Global warming threatens world food supplies, high temperatures will
expose hundreds of millions to potentially leathal heat stress, forest
fires and flooding will threaten many areas that have seemed secure
in the past.

The operation of the capitalist market is incapable of solving this problem
since it is the original cause of the problem in the first place. Only
deliberate planning of the economy to meet environmental needs can 
attain that. Such planning was practiced by socialist countries but has
passed out of consideration since 1990. In its place come pseudo market
solutions like markets in carbon emissions and offsets. What the green 
new deals promoted by the Democrat left in the US and the Labour Party
in the UK fail to do is work out in detail the total transformation
that would be needed to achieve their objectives. The economy is 
a complex feedback system such that changes in one area involve consequential
effects elsewhere.

The conceptual tools developed by input output analysis and Soviet optimal
planning theory provide a way in which we can work out what a green
plan would involve. The aim is to produce an outline example of such
a plan as a means of focusing debate on socialist alternatives to 
the 'new deal' model. We would aim to produce a detailed report, articles
and videos explaining the plan once we have developed it.

If we prototype this for one economy, the methodology could be relatively
easily reproduced for other industrial countries.
