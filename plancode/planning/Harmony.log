I've just read as much of that statement as I could fathom,
so a semicolon should have been next. It's very puzzling...
but I'll try to get myself back together, by ignoring
everything up to the next `;'. Please insert a semicolon
now in front of anything that you don't want me to delete.

The next thing in this loop should have been `=' or `:='.
But don't worry; I'll pretend that an equals sign
was present, and I'll look for the values next.

Oh dear. I can't decide if the expression above is positive,
negative, or zero. So this comparison test won't be `true'.

The next thing in this loop should have been a `:'.
So I'll pretend that a colon was present;
everything from here to `endfor' will be iterated.

I can't handle numbers bigger than about 4095.99998;
so I've changed your constant to that maximum amount.

I suspect you have forgotten an `endfor',
causing me to read past where you wanted me to stop.
I'll try to recover; but if the error is serious,
you'd better type `E' or `X' now and fix your file.
